              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>No centralized scheduling and notification system for production teams</li>
                <li>No transparency for pending and completed tasks between managers and assistants</li>
                <li>No real-time capabilities for call sheet updating and distribution</li>
                <li>Breakdown of communication between on and off-set resources</li>
                <li>Unnecessary overage costs from shooting locations and equipment rentals due to on set resource mismanagement</li>
                <li>Frequent mismanagement of petty cash resulted in loss of funds</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Our Plans</h2>
              <p>The first version of our modular mobile app will focus on one primary feature: schedule and notification coordination among project teams. Our team has found this to be a common pain point for our interview subject, and we have prioritized the development and testing of this first module. As we approach our initial user testing, we will develop modular “add-on” applications that cater to an increasing array of film and television production team needs.
              </p>
              <p>We highly value any user feedback, criticisms and support as we put our heads down and intend to rock the foundation of the media production process. We will be working hard in the next few months and we are super excited for our alpha launch.
