      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Through extensive market research and interviews with industry players, such as production managers, executive assistants at studios, production firms, and finance professionals, we discovered a valuable opportunity to improve the production process through enhanced communication and coordination tools. We found that the current process is grounded in archaic processes that result in numerous on (and off) set inefficiencies. Our team assembled though a combination of luck, fate, and love for collecting circa 1830's Elgin pocket watches.</p>
