    <h2>Our Plan</h2>
    <p>The first version of our modular mobile app will focus on one primary feature: schedule and notification coordination among project teams. Our team has found this to be a common pain point for our interview subject, and we have prioritized the development and testing of this first module. As we approach our initial user testing, we will develop modular “add-on” applications that cater to an increasing array of film and television production team needs.
    </p>
    <p>We highly value any user feedback, criticisms and support as we put our heads down and intend to rock the foundation of the media production process. We will be working hard in the next few months and we are super excited for our alpha launch. Sign up to be one of our alpha testers here [one of a few links to email signup page] and find us on twitter here. </p>
